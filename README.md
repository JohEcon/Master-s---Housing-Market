The simulation can be initialized by running "Model_Simulation_New_Method.py". For best results, run the model with at least 2000 households and for 2000 periods. Simulations with fewer agents or for fewer periods are possible, but do not produce reliable results, and if the model is run with very few agents, the model becomes unstable.

A wide array of variables, parameters and other settings of the model can be changed in "Settings.py" (Read the file to understand how and what can be changed in the model). 

After the model simulation has ended, some information about the agents of the model will be printed (how much information can be changed in settings). The most relevant time series produced by the simulation are printed in .txt files after the simulation has ended.
