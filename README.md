For best results, run the model with at least 2000 households and for 2000 periods. Simulations with fewer agents or for fewer periods are possible, but do not produce reliable results, and if the model is run with very few agents, the model becomes unstable.

The most relevant time series produced by the simulation are printed in .txt files after the simulation has ended.
